# Weather Forecast Cloud Project

This is my weather forecast project built using AWS.

## Frontend Files
- index.html
- script.js
- style.css
- logo.png

These files were hosted in AWS S3 as a static website.

## Backend
The backend is an AWS Lambda function written in Python.

File:
- lambda_function.py

This function was connected to API Gateway to get weather data.

## AWS Services Used
- S3 (Frontend hosting)
- Lambda (Backend)
- API Gateway (API Endpoint)
- CloudFront (CDN)
- DynamoDB (optional)
